I've been a developer for 8+ years. I've built enterprise platforms, automated complex workflows, and solved the kind of bugs that make senior engineers quietly close their laptops and go for a walk.

But I didn't have a portfolio site.

Not because I couldn't build one — because there was always something more urgent. Client work, production bugs, the next sprint. The classic developer paradox: we build for everyone except ourselves.

So when I finally decided to do it, I gave myself a constraint: **build it in one session, using Claude Code, and ship it the same day.**

Here's exactly what happened.

---

## The Stack

Before I touched anything, I knew what I wanted: dark mode, clean, fast, and something that actually feels like a developer built it — not a Squarespace template.

The final stack:

- **Next.js** with React and TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Three.js** for the 3D hero visual
- **Vercel** for deployment

Not a simple stack. This is a production-grade setup with 3D rendering, page transitions, and responsive design. The kind of thing that would normally take a weekend minimum to scaffold properly.

## Letting Claude Code Drive

Here's where it gets interesting.

I didn't use Claude as a chatbot to ask questions and then code it myself. I used **Claude Code directly** — the CLI tool — and let it build the entire project. I described what I wanted: the layout, the sections, the visual direction, the dark color palette. Claude Code generated the project structure, the components, the styling, the animations. All of it.

My role was more like a creative director than a developer. I gave instructions, reviewed the output, and adjusted course when needed. Claude Code didn't just write code — it understood the *intent* behind my requests and translated that into working components.

The most surprising part? **How accurately it captured my instructions.** I expected to spend significant time correcting misunderstandings or rewriting components. That barely happened. The gap between what I described and what Claude Code produced was remarkably small.

## The Deploy

This is where I expected friction. Setting up Git, connecting to Vercel, configuring the build — these are the boring steps where things usually break.

Claude Code walked me through it. Not in a "here's a tutorial" way, but in a "let me configure this for you" way. Git setup, repository creation, deployment configuration — it guided each step and handled what it could directly.

Within minutes of the code being done, the site was live.

## The Timeline

Let me be honest about the full hour:

- Deciding on the domain and buying it on Cloudflare
- Claude Code generating the entire project
- Reviewing and adjusting the output
- Setting up Git and deploying to Vercel
- Final checks

**Total: ~1 hour.** From zero to a production portfolio with Next.js, Three.js 3D visuals, Framer Motion animations, and live deployment.

To put that in perspective: scaffolding a Next.js project with TypeScript, configuring Tailwind, setting up Three.js with proper React integration, building responsive components with animations, and deploying — that's easily 8-15 hours of focused work for an experienced developer. Maybe more if you're particular about design.

## What Claude Code Did Well

I'll be specific:

**Project architecture.** It didn't just dump everything in one file. Proper component structure, clean separation of concerns, TypeScript types where they should be.

**Design interpretation.** I described a dark theme with specific accent colors and a clean, minimal feel. What I got back was exactly that — not a generic dark template, but something that felt intentional and cohesive.

**Context retention.** As I gave follow-up instructions ("make the hero section more impactful," "add a services grid," "include a contact section"), Claude Code maintained consistency across the entire project. The design language stayed coherent.

**Deployment guidance.** The transition from code to live site was seamless. It knew the Vercel workflow and guided me through it without unnecessary complexity.

## What I'd Watch For

No tool is perfect, and I want this to be an honest take.

This was a portfolio site — a relatively straightforward project in terms of business logic. I'm curious how Claude Code handles more complex scenarios: heavy state management, API integrations with edge cases, or debugging production issues in existing codebases. That's where I'll test it next.

For now, for this specific use case — building a polished, production-ready portfolio from scratch — it delivered beyond what I expected.

## The Bigger Picture

This experience shifted how I think about development workflows. Not in a "developers are being replaced" way — that's a lazy take. In a **"the bottleneck is moving"** way.

The bottleneck used to be writing code. Now it's shifting toward knowing *what* to build, *how* to describe it clearly, and *when* to adjust course. The skills that matter are becoming more architectural, more strategic, more about taste and judgment.

As a developer who's spent years solving complex enterprise problems, I see Claude Code as a force multiplier. It doesn't replace the thinking — it accelerates the execution. And for someone who values lateral thinking and creative problem-solving over typing speed, that's exactly the right trade.

## Try It Yourself

If you're a developer without a portfolio site (I know you're out there), this is your sign. The barrier to entry just dropped dramatically.

And if you're curious about the result: you're looking at it. This site — **guifarro.dev** — is what came out of that one-hour session.
